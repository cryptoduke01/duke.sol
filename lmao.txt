Okay here is the full stuff from grok, date of thread released, likes, comments and bookmarks 

so the numbering is that likes first, then comments, then bookmarks, then the hook and cover image is what will be the first thing to see i guess, just know how you will place the design

As a developer, I keep wondering why I contribute to open-source projects without getting recognized or a dime aside from my career development.
As a developer, I keep wondering why I contribute to open-source projects without getting recognized or a dime aside from my career development.

But thoughts are mostly problems with a solution we haven't found yet.

Fortunately, @DeTAProtocol

AI models trained on poor data are destined for failure!
AI models trained on poor data are destined for failure!

I struggled with AI models, which sometimes failed to deliver results, until I learned about the significance of high-quality data.

This may be why your AI assistant is underperforming without you even realizing it!

The issue isn't with the model, whether it's ChatGPT, Grok, or Deepseek; it's all about the data.

Here's how everything is changing:

Have you tried sending your girl $200 that stays in Nairobi?
Have you tried sending your girl $200 that stays in Nairobi?

USDT on Ethereum may cost you around $15 in fees and slow processing. Probably her local exchange doesn't even support it.

USDC may work, but you've seen accounts frozen without warning.

Sending stablecoins shouldn't be that hard!

That's where the $USDG from the @global_dollar
 network comes in. With low fees, no freeze riskand fully compliant for global use, let's see how it works

Why You’re Losing Money on Bridges and How to Solve It
Why You’re Losing Money on Bridges and How to Solve It

Cross-chain bridging costs you more than it should.

Traditional bridges lock funds for minutes, charge fees of $5-20, and involve complex processes, causing users to abandon transactions. 

This separation kills user experience and limits DeFi growth.

However, here's how @AcrossProtocol
 changes everything by providing a 2-second bridging solution for under $1, along with an intent-based system for instant fulfillment.

Decentralized exchanges are usually slower with higher slippage. 

But a new Solana-based DEX solved this by ensuring fast order execution while giving users full control over their wallets.
